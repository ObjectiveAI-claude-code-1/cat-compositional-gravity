Task 1 — Evaluate Focal Point Alignment: Identify where the cat is positioned within the photograph and assess how closely that position aligns with the natural focal points of the image. These focal points include the center of the frame and the four intersections created by dividing the image into equal thirds both horizontally and vertically. A cat whose body or face falls at or near one of these points of natural visual gravity benefits from the deep geometry of how humans scan images — the eye is drawn to these positions instinctively, and a subject placed there inherits an automatic sense of importance. A cat positioned far from any of these focal points, lost in the compositional no-man's-land between the center and the margins, occupies weaker ground. This task measures the proximity between where the cat actually is and where the most compositionally powerful positions in the frame lie.

Task 2 — Evaluate Centrality of Presence: Assess whether the cat occupies the broad middle ground of the image or has been pushed toward the boundaries of the frame. This is distinct from focal point alignment — it is not about hitting a specific intersection, but about whether the cat commands the interior stage of the photograph or has been relegated to its edges. A cat surrounded by the frame on all sides feels like the principal actor on a stage built for it. A cat pressed against the left or right margin feels like it is about to exit the scene. A cat crammed into the top of the image feels pinned against a ceiling, and a cat sinking to the very bottom feels grounded in the least important band of the composition. This task evaluates the cat's distance from the perimeter of the frame — whether the photograph wraps around the cat like a setting designed for it, or whether the cat has been crowded into a corner or squeezed against an edge where it feels secondary to the empty space around it.

Task 3 — Evaluate Subject Intentionality: Make a holistic judgment about whether the cat's position within the frame communicates that it is the intended subject of the photograph. This is the overall impression that emerges from the interplay of focal point alignment and centrality, but it is more than the sum of those parts. It is the feeling a viewer gets, before any conscious analysis, that this photograph was made of this cat — not a photograph that happens to contain a cat, and not a photograph of a room where a cat is also present. A cat with strong subject intentionality is positioned the way important things are positioned: where a portrait painter would place a face, where a cinematographer would place the character who is speaking, where a magazine cover would place its central image. A cat with weak subject intentionality may be technically visible, but its position suggests it wandered into someone else's scene — it sits in background territory, in the margins where captions go, in the dead space the eye skips over. This task assesses whether the cat's placement announces its subjecthood or merely acknowledges its presence.
