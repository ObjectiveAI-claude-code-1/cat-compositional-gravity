Evaluate the cat's positional authority within the frame. Determine where the cat is situated relative to the natural focal points of the image — the center, the rule-of-thirds intersections, and the overall visual stage of the composition. A cat positioned at or near these points of natural visual gravity benefits from the geometry of human attention; the eye is drawn there instinctively. A cat placed prominently in the heart of the image radiates intentionality and ownership of the scene. Conversely, a cat pushed to the far edges or corners of the frame — no matter how large — can feel like it is on the verge of leaving the picture rather than commanding it. A cat squeezed into the top margin or sinking into the bottom feels secondary to the space around it. A cat with strong positional authority scores high (closer to 1) — it occupies the compositional ground where the eye expects to find the most important thing in the photograph. A cat with weak positional authority scores low (closer to 0) — it is placed at the periphery, in the margins, or otherwise positioned where subjects of secondary importance tend to appear. This task assesses whether the cat holds the compositional high ground that signals it is the subject of the image rather than a bystander.
